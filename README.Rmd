This data package contains a data set of the registered elevator devices in New York City provided by the Department of Buildings in response to a September 2015 FOIL request.

## Installation

You can install the development version of elevators like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("emilhvitfeldt/elevators")
```

## Examples

One of the fundamental characteristics about elevators is how fast they can go, and how much they can carry

```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(elevators)
library(ggplot2)

elevators |>
  ggplot(aes(speed_fpm, capacity_lbs)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1)
```

In addition to `borough`, there are a number of geographical variables can would be useful to explore

```{r}
elevators |>
  ggplot(aes(longitude, latitude, color = borough)) +
  coord_map() +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +
  theme_minimal()
```

We can also see where the different tall buildings are in Manhattan

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

elevators |>
  filter(borough == "Manhattan") |>
  mutate(floors = str_extract(floor_to, "\\d+"),
         floors = as.numeric(floors)) |>
  filter(!is.na(floors), floors < 100, floors > 0) |>
  ggplot(aes(longitude, latitude, color = floors)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.05) +
  scale_color_viridis_c() +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_wrap(~ cut_width(floors, width = 10, boundary = 0))
```
